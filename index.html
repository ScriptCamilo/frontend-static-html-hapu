          Sometimes it’s hard enough just sharing a

          week out and you might encounter more
          than a few snares. But not with Hapu.
          Simply set your rates and our automated
          payment system takes care of the rest. You
          need never talk money or who owes what.

          Childcare is for the long term. And you

          gives your share long term viability and
          success. That’s why we’ve defined Hapu
          around our three tribal principles; clearly
          defined process, transparency over money
          and equality of participation.
